\chapter{Approach}
\section{Version 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Implementation 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Ist Phase} : creating signature using linked list and cross comparison
            \item \textbf{IInd Phase} : comparisons between signature and inputs sequence
        \end{itemize}
    \item[] {Advantage}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Signature was always linear
            \item Signature required less space
            \item Easier computation and used link list
        \end{itemize}
    \item[] {Disadvantage}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Signature followed the smallest input
            \item Signature soon became inadequate as it was too small
            \item Did not consider the system calls that are rejected if it didn't exist in both. Hence had to modify unique
        \end{itemize}
    \item[] {Points to be noted}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Signature needs to include branches not done during learning phase
            \item System calls like mutex, poll and futex repeated many times hence were not considered during signature creation
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Version 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {Signature now includes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A backbone sequence is created by finding the common sequence of system calls in the input dataset
            \item Rest of the elements are added to the signature in the forms of pairs as per their occurrences in the input sequence after processing
            \item Unique list of system calls to identify those system calls that are never used
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
