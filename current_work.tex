\section{Current Work}

\subsection{Idea}
Basic idea behind, is to make a signature for uniquely identifying an application. Then compare the input sequence of system calls of a random process with the set of signatures. After calculating the deviation from the signature, if it is over a threshold value for a certain process then consider that as a malware.

\subsection{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{Ist Phase}: Preprocessing Stage
    \item[] \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \textbf{Input}: A sequence of system calls during normal running of an application. 
                \item[] \textbf{Output}: A resultant sequence of system calls after eliminating the consecutive repetition of sequences of system calls and the size of the largest repeating sequence.
            \end{itemize}
    \item[] Description: To avoid data redundancy during signature creation by modifying the sequence of system calls in such a way that information is not lost while integrity itâ€™s is retained.

    \item[] \textbf{IInd Phase}: Processing Stage
    \item[] \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \textbf{Input}: Set of sequence of system calls from various normal runs of an application over different inputs, after undergoing the preprocessing stage.
                \item[] \textbf{Output}: Creates a consolidated signature without losing any information from any of the sequence of system calls.
            \end{itemize}
    \item[] Description : Signature creation for each applications from the set of sequential system calls  multiple runs.

    \item[] \textbf{IIIrd Phase}: Feedback system.
    \item[] \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \textbf{Input}: The signature of the application and sequence of system calls or an attack of the known application to be incorporated into the signature.
                \item[] \textbf{Output}: Additional sequence of system calls are incorporated or a sequence of system calls are removed from the signature hence thereby a system of feedback is incorporated.
            \end{itemize}
    \item[] Description: Feedback system and hence improving the signature.

    \item[] IVth Phase: Malware detection.
    \item[] \begin{itemize}
                \item[] \textbf{Input}: Set of signatures of the applications considered and the log of system calls for the running of an unknown application.
                \item[] \textbf{Output}: Classifying the application as a malware or as normal running.
            \end{itemize}
    \item[] Description: Identifying anomaly in the running of an application by matching with the created set of signature.
\end{itemize}
