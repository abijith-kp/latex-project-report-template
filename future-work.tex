\subsection{Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] Threshold measure in terms of the entity to be observed and the threshold count of the entity, to identify the anomaly is to be found
    \item[] An automated system for doing both signature creation and attack identification is to be implemented
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Dataset was obtained from: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~immsec/begin.html
