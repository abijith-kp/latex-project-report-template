\section{Work Remaining}

\subsection{Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[*] Threshold measure in terms of the entity to be observed and the threshold count of the entity, to identify the anomaly is to be found.
    \item[*] A buffer will be incorporated in the software design in order to work with dynamic inputs.
    \item[*] An automated system for doing both signature creation and attack identification is to be implemented.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[*] Dataset was obtained from: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~immsec/begin.html
        \item[*] Processes which are used for testing intrution detection are sendmail, ftp, lpr, xlock, named, login, ps, inetd, sendmail.
    \end{itemize}
